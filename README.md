# Encryptor / Decryptor Web App

A simple browser-based encryption and decryption tool built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.  
Users can encrypt text or data and later decrypt it directly in the browser without any backend — everything runs client-side for privacy and simplicity.

**Live Demo:** https://devanshkaushik17.github.io/Encryptor/

## About

This project provides a minimal web interface where users can encrypt and decrypt information safely in their browser. All operations are done locally — no server, no database — which helps protect user data and passwords from leaving the user’s machine. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Ideal for learning and experimentation with basic client-side cryptographic interactions in a static web environment.

## Features

- **Client-Side Processing** — Encrypt/decrypt without sending data to a server.  
- **Easy to Use** — User clicks, submits input and gets output instantly.  
- **Single Page App** — Built entirely with static HTML, CSS & JS.  
- **No Dependencies** — Does not require backend services or databases.  
- **Live Demo Hosted on GitHub Pages**

## How It Works

1. **Enter Data** — Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.  
2. **Submit** — Click the appropriate button to encrypt or decrypt.  
3. **Result** — View or copy the output directly from the page.  

Cryptographic logic (whether simple ciphers or more advanced algorithm use) executes in the browser using JavaScript, taking advantage of client-side capabilities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Security Note:** This tool is intended for basic encryption experiments and learning. For sensitive or production-grade cryptographic needs, use proven libraries and protocols.
